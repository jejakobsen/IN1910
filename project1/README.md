There was found a problem in __test_double_pendulum.py__ where at line 50 it
calculating wrong when the last value of potential and kinetic energy was used.
It did however work with the secondlast value.

The animation from the __double_pendulum__ scipt did also move faster
than the .mp4 file that was made.
